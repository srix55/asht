A user can belong to multiple teams. In case of conflict in permissions - suppose the user is restricted in a particular space but is assigned into a team that grants it, then the restriction takes priority.\nSuper-administrators # Every client account has one or more super-administrators. By default, the one who creates an account with us is given the super-administrator status. Super administrators can do everything that\u0026rsquo;s permissible within the bounds of a client account. However, they cannot demote another super-administrator, even though they can promote users to super-administrators.\nUsers \u0026amp; Spaces # Every user is assigned a primary space, which he has default access to However, it can be changed to allow a user to have specific access rights (such as read-only, write-only) to specific one or more spaces Spaces # Spaces are used to group resources for better management \u0026amp; to separate concerns. Example, East-brewary organization has branch A \u0026amp; branch B spaces with their own players, content creators \u0026amp; billing cycles. Spaces are enabled in the app-store.\nCan be categorized in the UI as Organization/Branch/Space/Area/Zone Spaces can be active or suspended (owing to non payment of bills or misuse for example) Every resource (player, user, playlist, media) belongs to a space. A space is a tree structure with content-access optionally shared with descendents/ancestors of that space. For example, Let\u0026rsquo;s say an organization X has 3 branches A, B \u0026amp; C with C having indoor \u0026amp; outdoor areas. Then, Space X has three sub-spaces A,B \u0026amp; C with C having 2 sub-spaces indoor \u0026amp; outdoor. Content shared with ancestors/descendents can be of particular types only like media only, playlists only etc Access can also be given to particular spaces including or not including sub-spaces A space has a settings screen of its own It can have a setting that disables showing that a user doesn\u0026rsquo;t have a particular permission in PS A space can limit Number of players under that space, exceeding which sends an alert or which cannot be exceeded A fixed cost, exceeding which sends an alert or which cannot be exceeded Security # Every resource in the app such as player, playlist, media etc \u0026amp; actions on them (read/write) needs authorization. It\u0026rsquo;s managed with\nPermissions (or restrictions) Roles (collection of permissions/restrictions) Spaces (scope of security, app-optional) Resources (individually lockable entities, app-optional) Teams (collection of roles/permissions, app-optional) What\u0026rsquo;s a resource? # A resource can be specific media (pic, video, audio, app-specific like twitter-feed-of-so etc), playlist, folder, player, schedule. Each can be differentiated by its id. For example, pl-123, fo-123, pa-123, sc-123 etc\nPermissions # Permissions by themselves do not specify the resource, space scope, role, user or expiry dates. However they can be added to a user, team or role to include a specific resource, space or user with expiry dates. Examples:-\nplayer:get player:update player:create player.notes:create player.notes:delete Roles \u0026amp; Permissions # A role is a set of specific permissions (granted or denied) associated with specific resources (space is a resource too) and can have expiry dates. A role may be visible only in particular spaces, with optional subspaces. Requirements:-\nPermissions can not just be granted, but can also be denied. For example, user A does NOT have access to folder T. A user can have different roles in different spaces. Example, user A is a publisher in space first-floor but just a viewer in space london-branch. A permission in a role can have validity time period. Example, viewer role can see folder T only on 1st Jan 2024 A permission in a role can be space-wide. Example, viewer role can see all folders of space T. Role visibility is a thing. Example, role first-floor-publisher is only visible in space first-floor and its subspaces Permission Conflicts \u0026amp; Hierarchy # Direct user permissions (grant/deny) trumps role \u0026amp; team permissions Even in direct user permissions, granularity is given priority. For example, if a user has playlist:set permission (grant) on a folder but a playlist:set permission (deny) on a particular playlist in that folder, then the deny wins. Similarly, if playlist:set is granted at the space level but the folder denies it, the deny wins. Role permissions trump team permissions Even in role permissions, granularity matters. For example, If the role grants playlist:set on the space but denies the same for a folder in that space, the deny wins. Preset Roles # Viewer: Can see every part of the space he belongs to, except billing Content Maker: Can create, edit or delete media of the space he belongs to Admin: Can see \u0026amp; edit every part of the space he belongs to Roles \u0026amp; Teams # Teams can be enabled via the app-store. It\u0026rsquo;s just to make user-role management easier. Example, user A belongs to team content-makers-for-london-branch which is a team that\u0026rsquo;s given view \u0026amp; publish permissions in london-branch. A team can have validity dates, so can the roles that it constitutes. Team visibility is a thing, including option to make it visible in subspaces.\nPermissions \u0026amp; Spaces # A space can be set to have its content be visible for its ancestors and/or descendants A space can also be set to have its content be visible in specific spaces \u0026amp; subspaces A particular resource of a space can be made visible for specific spaces \u0026amp; subspaces The space hierarchy is maintained as a materialized path (or enumerated path or lineage) in the database Space Settings # Session Policies # After how much inactivity time, an account gets auto logged out IP blacklist \u0026amp; whitelist Permissions # Space permissions # Enforce 2 factor authentication Allow admin to give out passwords for users Archived Ideas # Temporary permissions: A user gets to request for permissions to a resource upon which the administrator gets a notification to grant the permission for say 15 minutes. Though sounds great, it\u0026rsquo;s a lot of work and isn\u0026rsquo;t something anyone\u0026rsquo;s wanting to have. None of the competition has this. Permissions with expiry dates: An admin can grant permissions that are time bound with start and end date times. Not sure if anyone is asking for this. Not sure if it\u0026rsquo;s worth it - implementing. Teams with overridable permissions: A team\u0026rsquo;s collection of permissions (roles) can be overridden. Too many levels of flexibility leads to confusion as it can already be done at the role level. Soft deletes in the database. No need I guess. Have good auditing. Apps # An app can have its own billing, restrictions \u0026amp; limitations. Apps determine how simple or how complex the system can be.\nDev Notes # There\u0026rsquo;s no tenant-wide app installation (internally). So, every app is either installed or not for particular spaces.\nInfrastructure Apps # Roles # Teams # Have users assigned to a team. Helps in case of multi level organizations that constantly hire \u0026amp; fire employees. A team can be given a default role such that all team members get assigned to those roles. Team is also a resource that is space(s) bound. A user can be in multiple teams with overlapping roles in each.\nSpaces # For organizations that want something more than tags to manage workspaces. Option to include multiple organizations/branches/spaces/areas/zones\nLanguages # Multi language support\nSingle-SignOn # Amazon, Apple, Google, SalesForce, OneLogin, Okta, Microsoft\nPlayback reports or Audit reports # What played and what didn\u0026rsquo;t presented as exportable csv reports\nAudit logs # What user did what, held in our servers for a month.

I assume that you are familiar with HTML, the bash command line, and that you are comfortable using Markdown to format content. I\u0026rsquo;ll explain how Hugo uses templates and how you can organize your templates to create a theme. I won\u0026rsquo;t cover using CSS to style your theme.\nWe\u0026rsquo;ll start with creating a new site with a very basic template. Then we\u0026rsquo;ll add in a few pages and posts. With small variations on that, you will be able to create many different types of web sites.\nIn this tutorial, commands that you enter will start with the \u0026ldquo;$\u0026rdquo; prompt. The output will follow. Lines that start with \u0026ldquo;#\u0026rdquo; are comments that I\u0026rsquo;ve added to explain a point. When I show updates to a file, the \u0026ldquo;:wq\u0026rdquo; on the last line means to save the file.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s an example:\n## this is a comment $ echo this is a command this is a command ## edit the file $ vi foo.md +++ date = \u0026#34;2014-09-28\u0026#34; title = \u0026#34;creating a new theme\u0026#34; +++ bah and humbug :wq ## show it $ cat foo.md +++ date = \u0026#34;2014-09-28\u0026#34; title = \u0026#34;creating a new theme\u0026#34; +++ bah and humbug $ Some Definitions # There are a few concepts that you need to understand before creating a theme.\nSkins # Skins are the files responsible for the look and feel of your site. It’s the CSS that controls colors and fonts, it’s the Javascript that determines actions and reactions. It’s also the rules that Hugo uses to transform your content into the HTML that the site will serve to visitors.\nYou have two ways to create a skin. The simplest way is to create it in the layouts/ directory. If you do, then you don’t have to worry about configuring Hugo to recognize it. The first place that Hugo will look for rules and files is in the layouts/ directory so it will always find the skin.\nYour second choice is to create it in a sub-directory of the themes/ directory. If you do, then you must always tell Hugo where to search for the skin. It’s extra work, though, so why bother with it?\nThe difference between creating a skin in layouts/ and creating it in themes/ is very subtle. A skin in layouts/ can’t be customized without updating the templates and static files that it is built from. A skin created in themes/, on the other hand, can be and that makes it easier for other people to use it.\nThe rest of this tutorial will call a skin created in the themes/ directory a theme.\nNote that you can use this tutorial to create a skin in the layouts/ directory if you wish to. The main difference will be that you won’t need to update the site’s configuration file to use a theme.\nThe Home Page # The home page, or landing page, is the first page that many visitors to a site see. It is the index.html file in the root directory of the web site. Since Hugo writes files to the public/ directory, our home page is public/index.html.\nSite Configuration File # When Hugo runs, it looks for a configuration file that contains settings that override default values for the entire site. The file can use TOML, YAML, or JSON. I prefer to use TOML for my configuration files. If you prefer to use JSON or YAML, you’ll need to translate my examples. You’ll also need to change the name of the file since Hugo uses the extension to determine how to process it.\nHugo translates Markdown files into HTML. By default, Hugo expects to find Markdown files in your content/ directory and template files in your themes/ directory. It will create HTML files in your public/ directory. You can change this by specifying alternate locations in the configuration file.\nContent # Content is stored in text files that contain two sections. The first section is the “front matter,” which is the meta-information on the content. The second section contains Markdown that will be converted to HTML.\nFront Matter # The front matter is information about the content. Like the configuration file, it can be written in TOML, YAML, or JSON. Unlike the configuration file, Hugo doesn’t use the file’s extension to know the format. It looks for markers to signal the type. TOML is surrounded by “+++”, YAML by “---”, and JSON is enclosed in curly braces. I prefer to use TOML, so you’ll need to translate my examples if you prefer YAML or JSON.\nThe information in the front matter is passed into the template before the content is rendered into HTML.\nMarkdown # Content is written in Markdown which makes it easier to create the content. Hugo runs the content through a Markdown engine to create the HTML which will be written to the output file.\nTemplate Files # Hugo uses template files to render content into HTML. Template files are a bridge between the content and presentation. Rules in the template define what content is published, where it\u0026rsquo;s published to, and how it will rendered to the HTML file. The template guides the presentation by specifying the style to use.\nThere are three types of templates: single, list, and partial. Each type takes a bit of content as input and transforms it based on the commands in the template.\nHugo uses its knowledge of the content to find the template file used to render the content. If it can’t find a template that is an exact match for the content, it will shift up a level and search from there. It will continue to do so until it finds a matching template or runs out of templates to try. If it can’t find a template, it will use the default template for the site.\nPlease note that you can use the front matter to influence Hugo’s choice of templates.\nSingle Template # A single template is used to render a single piece of content. For example, an article or post would be a single piece of content and use a single template.\nList Template # A list template renders a group of related content. That could be a summary of recent postings or all articles in a category. List templates can contain multiple groups.\nThe homepage template is a special type of list template. Hugo assumes that the home page of your site will act as the portal for the rest of the content in the site.\nPartial Template # A partial template is a template that can be included in other templates. Partial templates must be called using the “partial” template command. They are very handy for rolling up common behavior. For example, your site may have a banner that all pages use. Instead of copying the text of the banner into every single and list template, you could create a partial with the banner in it. That way if you decide to change the banner, you only have to change the partial template.\nCreate a New Site # Let\u0026rsquo;s use Hugo to create a new web site. I\u0026rsquo;m a Mac user, so I\u0026rsquo;ll create mine in my home directory, in the Sites folder. If you\u0026rsquo;re using Linux, you might have to create the folder first.\nThe \u0026ldquo;new site\u0026rdquo; command will create a skeleton of a site. It will give you the basic directory structure and a useable configuration file.\n$ hugo new site ~/Sites/zafta $ cd ~/Sites/zafta $ ls -l total 8 drwxr-xr-x 7 quoha staff 238 Sep 29 16:49 . drwxr-xr-x 3 quoha staff 102 Sep 29 16:49 .. drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 archetypes -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 82 Sep 29 16:49 config.toml drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 content drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 layouts drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 static $ Take a look in the content/ directory to confirm that it is empty.\nThe other directories (archetypes/, layouts/, and static/) are used when customizing a theme. That\u0026rsquo;s a topic for a different tutorial, so please ignore them for now.\nGenerate the HTML For the New Site # Running the hugo command with no options will read all the available content and generate the HTML files. It will also copy all static files (that\u0026rsquo;s everything that\u0026rsquo;s not content). Since we have an empty site, it won\u0026rsquo;t do much, but it will do it very quickly.\n$ hugo --verbose INFO: 2014/09/29 Using config file: config.toml INFO: 2014/09/29 syncing from /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/static/ to /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/public/ WARN: 2014/09/29 Unable to locate layout: [index.html _default/list.html _default/single.html] WARN: 2014/09/29 Unable to locate layout: [404.html] 0 draft content 0 future content 0 pages created 0 tags created 0 categories created in 2 ms $ The \u0026ldquo;--verbose\u0026rdquo; flag gives extra information that will be helpful when we build the template.

The lines that start with \u0026ldquo;WARN:\u0026rdquo; are warning messages. We\u0026rsquo;ll go over them later.\nWe can verify that the command worked by looking at the directory again.\n$ ls -l total 8 drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 archetypes -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 82 Sep 29 16:49 config.toml drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 content drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 layouts drwxr-xr-x 4 quoha staff 136 Sep 29 17:02 public drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 static $ See that new public/ directory?

It will dramatically shorten your development cycle if you do. Start it by running the \u0026ldquo;server\u0026rdquo; command. If it is successful, you will see output similar to the following:\n$ hugo server --verbose INFO: 2014/09/29 Using config file: /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/config.toml INFO: 2014/09/29 syncing from /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/static/ to /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/public/ WARN: 2014/09/29 Unable to locate layout: [index.html _default/list.html _default/single.html] WARN: 2014/09/29 Unable to locate layout: [404.html] 0 draft content 0 future content 0 pages created 0 tags created 0 categories created in 2 ms Serving pages from /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/public Web Server is available at http://localhost:1313 Press Ctrl+C to stop Connect to the listed URL (it\u0026rsquo;s on the line that starts with \u0026ldquo;Web Server\u0026rdquo;). If everything is working correctly, you should get a page that shows the following:\nindex.xml sitemap.xml That\u0026rsquo;s a listing of your public/ directory. Hugo didn\u0026rsquo;t create a home page because our site has no content. When there\u0026rsquo;s no index.html file in a directory, the server lists the files in the directory, which is what you should see in your browser.\nLet’s go back and look at those warnings again.\nWARN: 2014/09/29 Unable to locate layout: [index.html _default/list.html _default/single.html] WARN: 2014/09/29 Unable to locate layout: [404.html] That second warning is easier to explain. We haven’t created a template to be used to generate “page not found errors.” The 404 message is a topic for a separate tutorial.\nNow for the first warning. It is for the home page. You can tell because the first layout that it looked for was “index.html.” That’s only used by the home page.\nI like that the verbose flag causes Hugo to list the files that it\u0026rsquo;s searching for. For the home page, they are index.html, _default/list.html, and _default/single.html. There are some rules that we\u0026rsquo;ll cover later that explain the names and paths. For now, just remember that Hugo couldn\u0026rsquo;t find a template for the home page and it told you so.\nAt this point, you\u0026rsquo;ve got a working installation and site that we can build upon. All that’s left is to add some content and a theme to display it.\nCreate a New Theme # Hugo doesn\u0026rsquo;t ship with a default theme. There are a few available (I counted a dozen when I first installed Hugo) and Hugo comes with a command to create new themes.\nWe\u0026rsquo;re going to create a new theme called \u0026ldquo;zafta.\u0026rdquo; Since the goal of this tutorial is to show you how to fill out the files to pull in your content, the theme will not contain any CSS. In other words, ugly but functional.\nAll themes have opinions on content and layout. For example, Zafta uses \u0026ldquo;post\u0026rdquo; over \u0026ldquo;blog\u0026rdquo;. Strong opinions make for simpler templates but differing opinions make it tougher to use themes. When you build a theme, consider using the terms that other themes do.\nCreate a Skeleton # Use the hugo \u0026ldquo;new\u0026rdquo; command to create the skeleton of a theme. This creates the directory structure and places empty files for you to fill out.\n$ hugo new theme zafta $ ls -l total 8 drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 archetypes -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 82 Sep 29 16:49 config.toml drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 content drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 layouts drwxr-xr-x 4 quoha staff 136 Sep 29 17:02 public drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 static drwxr-xr-x 3 quoha staff 102 Sep 29 17:31 themes $ find themes -type f | xargs ls -l -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 1081 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/LICENSE.md -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/archetypes/default.md -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/layouts/_default/list.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/layouts/_default/single.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/layouts/index.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/layouts/partials/footer.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/layouts/partials/header.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 93 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/theme.toml $ The skeleton includes templates (the files ending in .html), license file, a description of your theme (the theme.toml file), and an empty archetype.\nPlease take a minute to fill out the theme.toml and LICENSE.md files.

This is the file public/index.html. Hugo created a css/ directory. Hugo created a js/ directory. Hugo claimed that it created 0 pages. It created a file and copied over static files, but didn\u0026rsquo;t create any pages.

The home page is special because it gets its own type of template and its own template file. The file, layouts/index.html, is used to generate the HTML for the home page. The Hugo documentation says that this is the only required template, but that depends.

We noticed that when we built the site without having a theme installed.\nWhen Hugo created our theme, it created an empty home page template. Now, when we build the site, Hugo finds the template and uses it to generate the HTML for the home page. Since the template file is empty, the HTML file is empty, too.

Hugo makes this very easy:\nPurge the public/ directory. Run the built in web server in watch mode. Open your site in a browser. Update the theme. Glance at your browser window to see changes. Return to step 4. I’ll throw in one more opinion: never work on a theme on a live site. Always work on a copy of your site. Make changes to your theme, test them, then copy them up to your site. For added safety, use a tool like Git to keep a revision history of your content and your theme. Believe me when I say that it is too easy to lose both your mind and your changes.\nCheck the main Hugo site for information on using Git with Hugo.\nPurge the public/ Directory # When generating the site, Hugo will create new files and update existing ones in the public/ directory. It will not delete files that are no longer used. For example, files that were created in the wrong directory or with the wrong title will remain. If you leave them, you might get confused by them later. I recommend cleaning out your site prior to generating it.\nNote: If you\u0026rsquo;re building on an SSD, you should ignore this. Churning on a SSD can be costly.\nHugo\u0026rsquo;s Watch Option # Hugo\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;--watch\u0026rdquo; option will monitor the content/ and your theme directories for changes and rebuild the site automatically.\nLive Reload # Hugo\u0026rsquo;s built in web server supports live reload.

Every HTML file that Hugo creates is treated as a page, so looping through the list of pages will look at every file that will be created.\nThe \u0026ldquo;.Title\u0026rdquo; command prints the value of the \u0026ldquo;title\u0026rdquo; variable. Hugo pulls it from the front matter in the Markdown file.\nThe \u0026ldquo;end\u0026rdquo; command signals the end of the range iterator. The engine loops back to the top of the iteration when it finds \u0026ldquo;end.\u0026rdquo; Everything between the \u0026ldquo;range\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;end\u0026rdquo; is evaluated every time the engine goes through the iteration. In this file, that would cause the title from the first ten pages to be output as heading level one.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s helpful to remember that some variables, like .Data, are created before any output files. Hugo loads every content file into the variable and then gives the template a chance to process before creating the HTML files.\nBuild the web site and then verify the results.\n$ rm -rf public $ hugo --verbose INFO: 2014/09/29 Using config file: /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/config.toml INFO: 2014/09/29 syncing from /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/themes/zafta/static/ to /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/public/ INFO: 2014/09/29 syncing from /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/static/ to /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/public/ INFO: 2014/09/29 found taxonomies: map[string]string{\u0026#34;tag\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;tags\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;category\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;categories\u0026#34;} WARN: 2014/09/29 Unable to locate layout: [404.html theme/404.html] 0 draft content 0 future content 2 pages created 0 tags created 0 categories created in 4 ms $ find public -type f -name \u0026#39;*.html\u0026#39; | xargs ls -l -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 94 Sep 29 22:23 public/index.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 22:23 public/post/first/index.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 22:23 public/post/index.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 22:23 public/post/second/index.html $ cat public/index.html \u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;second\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;first\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; $ Congratulations, the home page shows the title of the two posts.

All that\u0026rsquo;s really left is understanding which template will be used to generate each content file and becoming familiar with the commands for the template engine.\nAnd, if that were entirely true, this tutorial would be much shorter. There are a few things to know that will make creating a new template much easier. Don\u0026rsquo;t worry, though, that\u0026rsquo;s all to come.\nAdd Content to the Posts # We\u0026rsquo;re working with posts, which are in the content/post/ directory. That means that their section is \u0026ldquo;post\u0026rdquo; (and if we don\u0026rsquo;t do something weird, their type is also \u0026ldquo;post\u0026rdquo;).\nHugo uses the section and type to find the template file for every piece of content. Hugo will first look for a template file that matches the section or type name. If it can\u0026rsquo;t find one, then it will look in the _default/ directory. There are some twists that we\u0026rsquo;ll cover when we get to categories and tags, but for now we can assume that Hugo will try post/single.html, then _default/single.html.\nNow that we know the search rule, let\u0026rsquo;s see what we actually have available:\n$ find themes/zafta -name single.html | xargs ls -l -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 132 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/layouts/_default/single.html We could create a new template, post/single.html, or change the default. Since we don\u0026rsquo;t know of any other content types, let\u0026rsquo;s start with updating the default.\nRemember, any content that we haven\u0026rsquo;t created a template for will end up using this template. That can be good or bad. Bad because I know that we\u0026rsquo;re going to be adding different types of content and we\u0026rsquo;re going to end up undoing some of the changes we\u0026rsquo;ve made. It\u0026rsquo;s good because we\u0026rsquo;ll be able to see immediate results. It\u0026rsquo;s also good to start here because we can start to build the basic layout for the site. As we add more content types, we\u0026rsquo;ll refactor this file and move logic around. Hugo makes that fairly painless, so we\u0026rsquo;ll accept the cost and proceed.\nPlease see the Hugo documentation on template rendering for all the details on determining which template to use. And, as the docs mention, if you\u0026rsquo;re building a single page application (SPA) web site, you can delete all of the other templates and work with just the default single page.

It is an extremely lightweight engine that provides a very small amount of logic. In our experience that it is just the right amount of logic to be able to create a good static website. If you have used other template systems from different languages or frameworks you will find a lot of similarities in Go templates.\nThis document is a brief primer on using Go templates. The Go docs provide more details.\nIntroduction to Go Templates # Go templates provide an extremely simple template language. It adheres to the belief that only the most basic of logic belongs in the template or view layer. One consequence of this simplicity is that Go templates parse very quickly.\nA unique characteristic of Go templates is they are content aware. Variables and content will be sanitized depending on the context of where they are used. More details can be found in the Go docs.\nBasic Syntax # Golang templates are HTML files with the addition of variables and functions.\nGo variables and functions are accessible within {{ }}\nAccessing a predefined variable \u0026ldquo;foo\u0026rdquo;:\n{{ foo }} Parameters are separated using spaces\nCalling the add function with input of 1, 2:\n{{ add 1 2 }} Methods and fields are accessed via dot notation\nAccessing the Page Parameter \u0026ldquo;bar\u0026rdquo;\n{{ .Params.bar }} Parentheses can be used to group items together\n{{ if or (isset .Params \u0026quot;alt\u0026quot;) (isset .Params \u0026quot;caption\u0026quot;) }} Caption {{ end }} Variables # Each Go template has a struct (object) made available to it. In hugo each template is passed either a page or a node struct depending on which type of page you are rendering. More details are available on the variables page.\nA variable is accessed by referencing the variable name.\n\u0026lt;title\u0026gt;{{ .Title }}\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; Variables can also be defined and referenced.\n{{ $address := \u0026quot;123 Main St.\u0026quot;}} {{ $address }} Functions # Go template ship with a few functions which provide basic functionality. The Go template system also provides a mechanism for applications to extend the available functions with their own. Hugo template functions provide some additional functionality we believe are useful for building websites. Functions are called by using their name followed by the required parameters separated by spaces. Template functions cannot be added without recompiling hugo.\nExample:\n{{ add 1 2 }} Includes # When including another template you will pass to it the data it will be able to access. To pass along the current context please remember to include a trailing dot. The templates location will always be starting at the /layout/ directory within Hugo.\nExample:\n{{ template \u0026quot;chrome/header.html\u0026quot; . }} Logic # Go templates provide the most basic iteration and conditional logic.\nIteration # Just like in Go, the Go templates make heavy use of range to iterate over a map, array or slice. The following are different examples of how to use range.\nExample 1: Using Context\n{{ range array }} {{ . }} {{ end }} Example 2: Declaring value variable name\n{{range $element := array}} {{ $element }} {{ end }} Example 2: Declaring key and value variable name\n{{range $index, $element := array}} {{ $index }} {{ $element }} {{ end }} Conditionals # If, else, with, or, \u0026amp; and provide the framework for handling conditional logic in Go Templates. Like range, each statement is closed with end.\nGo Templates treat the following values as false:\nfalse 0 any array, slice, map, or string of length zero Example 1: If\n{{ if isset .Params \u0026quot;title\u0026quot; }}\u0026lt;h4\u0026gt;{{ index .Params \u0026quot;title\u0026quot; }}\u0026lt;/h4\u0026gt;{{ end }} Example 2: If -\u0026gt; Else\n{{ if isset .Params \u0026quot;alt\u0026quot; }} {{ index .Params \u0026quot;alt\u0026quot; }} {{else}} {{ index .Params \u0026quot;caption\u0026quot; }} {{ end }} Example 3: And \u0026amp; Or\n{{ if and (or (isset .Params \u0026quot;title\u0026quot;) (isset .Params \u0026quot;caption\u0026quot;)) (isset .Params \u0026quot;attr\u0026quot;)}} Example 4: With\nAn alternative way of writing \u0026ldquo;if\u0026rdquo; and then referencing the same value is to use \u0026ldquo;with\u0026rdquo; instead. With rebinds the context . within its scope, and skips the block if the variable is absent.\nThe first example above could be simplified as:\n{{ with .Params.title }}\u0026lt;h4\u0026gt;{{ . }}\u0026lt;/h4\u0026gt;{{ end }} Example 5: If -\u0026gt; Else If\n{{ if isset .Params \u0026quot;alt\u0026quot; }} {{ index .Params \u0026quot;alt\u0026quot; }} {{ else if isset .Params \u0026quot;caption\u0026quot; }} {{ index .Params \u0026quot;caption\u0026quot; }} {{ end }} Pipes # One of the most powerful components of Go templates is the ability to stack actions one after another. This is done by using pipes. Borrowed from unix pipes, the concept is simple, each pipeline\u0026rsquo;s output becomes the input of the following pipe.\nBecause of the very simple syntax of Go templates, the pipe is essential to being able to chain together function calls. One limitation of the pipes is that they only can work with a single value and that value becomes the last parameter of the next pipeline.\nA few simple examples should help convey how to use the pipe.\nExample 1 :\n{{ if eq 1 1 }} Same {{ end }} is the same as\n{{ eq 1 1 | if }} Same {{ end }} It does look odd to place the if at the end, but it does provide a good illustration of how to use the pipes.\nExample 2 :\n{{ index .Params \u0026quot;disqus_url\u0026quot; | html }} Access the page parameter called \u0026ldquo;disqus_url\u0026rdquo; and escape the HTML.\nExample 3 :\n{{ if or (or (isset .Params \u0026quot;title\u0026quot;) (isset .Params \u0026quot;caption\u0026quot;)) (isset .Params \u0026quot;attr\u0026quot;)}} Stuff Here {{ end }} Could be rewritten as\n{{ isset .Params \u0026quot;caption\u0026quot; | or isset .Params \u0026quot;title\u0026quot; | or isset .Params \u0026quot;attr\u0026quot; | if }} Stuff Here {{ end }} Context (aka. the dot) # The most easily overlooked concept to understand about Go templates is that {{ . }} always refers to the current context. In the top level of your template this will be the data set made available to it. Inside of a iteration it will have the value of the current item. When inside of a loop the context has changed. . will no longer refer to the data available to the entire page. If you need to access this from within the loop you will likely want to set it to a variable instead of depending on the context.\nExample:\n{{ $title := .Site.Title }} {{ range .Params.tags }} \u0026lt;li\u0026gt; \u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;{{ $baseurl }}/tags/{{ . | urlize }}\u0026quot;\u0026gt;{{ . }}\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; - {{ $title }} \u0026lt;/li\u0026gt; {{ end }} Notice how once we have entered the loop the value of {{ . }} has changed. We have defined a variable outside of the loop so we have access to it from within the loop.\nHugo Parameters # Hugo provides the option of passing values to the template language through the site configuration (for sitewide values), or through the meta data of each specific piece of content. You can define any values of any type (supported by your front matter/config format) and use them however you want to inside of your templates.\nUsing Content (page) Parameters # In each piece of content you can provide variables to be used by the templates. This happens in the front matter.\nAn example of this is used in this documentation site. Most of the pages benefit from having the table of contents provided. Sometimes the TOC just doesn\u0026rsquo;t make a lot of sense. We\u0026rsquo;ve defined a variable in our front matter of some pages to turn off the TOC from being displayed.\nHere is the example front matter:\n--- title: \u0026#34;Permalinks\u0026#34; date: \u0026#34;2013-11-18\u0026#34; aliases: - \u0026#34;/doc/permalinks/\u0026#34; groups: [\u0026#34;extras\u0026#34;] groups_weight: 30 notoc: true --- Here is the corresponding code inside of the template:\n{{ if not .Params.notoc }} \u0026lt;div id=\u0026quot;toc\u0026quot; class=\u0026quot;well col-md-4 col-sm-6\u0026quot;\u0026gt; {{ .TableOfContents }} \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; {{ end }} Using Site (config) Parameters # In your top-level configuration file (eg, config.yaml) you can define site parameters, which are values which will be available to you in chrome.\nFor instance, you might declare:\nparams: CopyrightHTML: \u0026#34;Copyright \u0026amp;#xA9; 2013 John Doe. All Rights Reserved.\u0026#34; TwitterUser: \u0026#34;spf13\u0026#34; SidebarRecentLimit: 5 Within a footer layout, you might then declare a \u0026lt;footer\u0026gt; which is only provided if the CopyrightHTML parameter is provided, and if it is given, you would declare it to be HTML-safe, so that the HTML entity is not escaped again. This would let you easily update just your top-level config file each January 1st, instead of hunting through your templates.\n{{if .Site.Params.CopyrightHTML}}\u0026lt;footer\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;text-center\u0026#34;\u0026gt;{{.Site.Params.CopyrightHTML | safeHtml}}\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/footer\u0026gt;{{end}} An alternative way of writing the \u0026ldquo;if\u0026rdquo; and then referencing the same value is to use \u0026ldquo;with\u0026rdquo; instead. With rebinds the context . within its scope, and skips the block if the variable is absent:\n{{with .Site.Params.TwitterUser}}\u0026lt;span class=\u0026#34;twitter\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;https://twitter.com/{{.}}\u0026#34; rel=\u0026#34;author\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;img src=\u0026#34;/images/twitter.png\u0026#34; width=\u0026#34;48\u0026#34; height=\u0026#34;48\u0026#34; title=\u0026#34;Twitter: {{.}}\u0026#34; alt=\u0026#34;Twitter\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;{{end}} Finally, if you want to pull \u0026ldquo;magic constants\u0026rdquo; out of your layouts, you can do so, such as in this example:\n\u0026lt;nav class=\u0026#34;recent\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;Recent Posts\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;ul\u0026gt;{{range first .Site.Params.SidebarRecentLimit .Site.Recent}} \u0026lt;li\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;{{.RelPermalink}}\u0026#34;\u0026gt;{{.Title}}\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt; {{end}}\u0026lt;/ul\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/nav\u0026gt; "},{"id":22,"href":"/posts/hugoisforlovers/","title":"Getting Started with Hugo","section":"Blog","content":" Step 1.
